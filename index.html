    DARJYO aims to raise awareness and strengthen the capacities of key stakeholders in South Africa on the concepts, approaches, and tools for enabling climate-smart agriculture in the country.
 <br>
<h3>Principles of Climate Smart Agriculture</h3>
     related to climate change and climate-smart agriculture in South Africa's agricultural sector.
 <br>
<h3> Climate-Smart Crop Production</h3>
     explores how CSA differs from mainstream agriculture in crop production and why it is essential to adopt CSA given the impact of climate change.
 <br>
<h3> Climate-Smart Livestock Production</h3>
     focuses on the importance of livestock production for food security, the link between climate change and livestock production, ways to adapt livestock production to climate change.
 <br>
<h3> Climate-Smart Remote Sensing</h3>
     concepts and their application in the agriculture domain.
  <br> 

<h4>DARJYO - Project Q29 in South Africa</h4>
<br>Our intent is to create a network of sensors scattered across our fields, recording data about soil moisture, temperature, and even pest activity to a central hub. 
<br>It's real-time data that lets us tailor our farming practices with laser focus. 
<br><br>To conserve water: The system flags areas that are good for drip irrigation, saving our water resource for when our crops truly need it.
<br><br>Surprise frost: Predictive analytics will warn us beforehand, so we can cover our crops or set off sprinklers.
<br><br>DARJYO implementing Climate-smart agriculture is about rediscovering the wisdom of our ancestors – with a tech twist. 
<br>We're talking about practices like cover cropping. 
<br><br>Hay bales suppress weeds, retain moisture, and even add nutrients to the soil – a natural fertilizer factory right there in our field! 
<br><br>And with drone technology, we can even seed these cover crops with pinpoint accuracy.
<br><br>There are challenges, like making sure tech is accessible and ensuring the data is secure. 
<br>DARJYO is creating a digital symphony for our farm. 
<br>Data plays the melody, guiding our decisions, while traditional practices like cover cropping harmonize the whole thing. 
<br><br>The result? A healthier planet, thriving crops, and maybe even a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
